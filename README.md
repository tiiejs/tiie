# Motivation

Maybe, You were asking yourself, why someone decided to build other framework for Single Page Application, because there is a lot of available alternatives.

There are three reasons.
First that each framework requires a certain approach from the programmer to the creation process. It is often the case that the problem we want to solve is simpler than the solution. For example, we want to build simple form without two way data binding, but we need to care about that, because framework requires it from us. 

Second reason is, that there is a lot libraries, these libraries do great work, but a lot of them, are not compatile with frameworks, so programmers needs to create some bridget, to work with these libraries. Topijs does not require to create some strage thnigs to use libraries.

The third reason was to create it, create your own tool, check your ideas, gain new experiences.
